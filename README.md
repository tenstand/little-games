### The game area

The game gives a clear instruction as to what to do. The options are to choose from rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock. The buttons are interactive, so the user can click to make their choice.

### The game results

When the user clicks on an option a picture of what they chose comes up similtaneously to the computer choice, which is chosen at random as a result of the JavaScript code

The winner is shown by an announcenmnet of "You Win" or :Computer wins" or "it's a tie". The results are shown above the game so they can be easily tracked. The game is on a infinite loop, so the user can play against the computer for as long as they want.

### game options

The game options have been placed in the footer area and inlcude brightly coloured buttons, to make the game fun and playful.

## Testing

I have tested that this game works in different browsers - Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
The results are always correct.
The header, game area, rules and choice options are eay to read and understand.
Used Dev Tools to make sure the site is responsive for al screens including mobiles and tablets.
Ran the site through Lighthouse and was a little disappointed the accessibility wasn't 100% but overall it's quite a positive score.

## Bugs

### Unsolved bugs

The only bug relates to the alt attributes in the index.html on lines 31 & 32, but this will be addressed shortly. All other bugs have been resolved.

## Validator testing

HTML - Using the W3C validator it was found alt attributes had not been used, this is dues to the pictures only being visible when the user clicks an option button.

CSS - Using the W3C (Jigsaw) validator no errors were found

JS - Using the JS Hint validator no errors were found
